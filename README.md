# Paft Usage

To run the bot simply clone the repository and create the token.py file in the same location as Paft.py. 
Insert your Discord application client id to the file in the following structure.   

  ```python 
  token = 'YOUR DISCORD BOT API HERE'
  rapid_api_key = 'OPTIONAL RAPID API KEY HERE' 
  saucenao_key = 'OPTIONAL SAUCENAO API KEY HERE' 
  ```
  
After this is done simply run the Paft.py script and if all relevant modules are installed the bot should come online. 

To see what the bot does see the commands in the main file and cogs, or type ^help in a discord server it's active in.
